# Welcome to the Kicad-Library Repository

Before You start making Your symbols and 3D models which could be finally included in KiCad-Library repository, You have to be familiar with the content of two documents: 

1. **[KiCad Library Convetion](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/blob/master/KiCad_Library_Convention.txt)** which is a set of rules and guidelines You should take into account when creating Your work.
1. **[How To Contriibute](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/blob/master/How_To_Contribute.txt)** to know what steps should be taken to properly prepare a **Merge Request**, which will be dealt with by one of the librarians.
