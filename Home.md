# Welcome to the Kicad-Library Repository

This repository is separated into three folders, named [library](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/tree/master/library), [template](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/tree/master/template) and [modules](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/tree/master/modules).

1. **[library](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/tree/master/library)** contains the symbols for making schematics.
1. **[template](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/tree/master/template)** contains project templates from where you can start off, as well as the fp-lib-tables, which are a list specifying where to find each footprint library. These are the other repositories ending in ".pretty".
1. **[modules](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/tree/master/modules)** includes the 3D drawing of footprints in the subdirectory "packages3d" and the footprint documentation in the subdirectory "footprint_doc".

Before you start making your symbols and 3D models which can included in KiCad-Library repository, you have to be familiar with the content of two documents, also available as files in the repository:

1. **[[KiCad Library Convention]]** which is a set of rules and guidelines you should take into account when creating Your work.
1. **[[How To Contribute]]** to know what steps should be taken to properly prepare a **Pull Request**, which will be dealt with by one of the librarians.
